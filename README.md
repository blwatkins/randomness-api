# Randomness API

A Randomness-as-a-Service API, delivering random numbers, colors, lines of poetry, books, and more. Currently in alpha development.

This project is an exploration of randomness, but also an exploration of programming languages and frameworks.
Over time, the API will be implemented using multiple frameworks across multiple languages.
